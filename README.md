# What is this?
This site is a demonstration of front end development.

- [Components][components] built for organized reusable code
- Next.js server side rendering for performance and SEO
- Yes this site was custom-made for you! [Checkout the git commit history](https://github.com/CTOverton/LMG-Cover-Letter/commits/main) 

# What is this not?
This site is not a demonstration of full scale web app development. Rome wasn't built in a day! I focused this site on UI and UX, not on functionality.

> I'd love to have a conversation more in depth about my experience building fully featured web apps.
